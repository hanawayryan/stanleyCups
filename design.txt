My project begins with the 'introintent' fuction which asks the user for the hockey team they want to learn about. The
'team_choose" intent is open and listens for the user's response. This response is a slot in the intent and is stored in the
variable 'team'. This is sent to the 'getCupResponse' method.

The 'getCupResponse' method uses a 2D array to search for a string that matches the team variable. The 2D array is set up where
the first row is all the team names in the NHL that the user could say. The second row is the number of times the team directly
above it has won the cup. Using a for loop the function looks for a matching string if it doesn't find one the loop is exited and
the fuction returns a string saying "the team does not exist" back to the 'team_choose' function and the program ends. If it does
find a matching string, using that index it goes to the next row and gets the number of Stanley Cup victories for that column
index (each column is a team). Using if statements, based on the integer found the return is built to be gramatically correct so 
there is a different response for 0,1 and >1 total wins. The response is return to the 'team_choose' method where Alexa simply says
what is returned from the 'getCupResponse' method.

A section of 2D array
hurricanes  | blue jackets  | devils  | islanders | rangers |         \\31 columns total, one for each team, team name in row 0
    1       |      0        |   3     |     0     |   4     |         \\ Row 1 consists of corresponding Stanley cups wins. 
                                                                      \\ So hurricanes have 1 Stanley Cup.
